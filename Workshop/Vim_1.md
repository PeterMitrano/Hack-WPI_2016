# Hello Everyone! welcome to the workshop.

Today we're going to be learning a little bit about git and vim.

## What is Git?

Git is version control software, written by Linux Torvolds, the creator of the linux kernel.

## What is Vim?

Vim is a text editor. And when I say "text editor", I don't mean word processor. This is absolutely *nothing* like Microsoft Word. Forget everything you think you know about microsoft word, sublime text, or god forbid Notepad. Vi/vim is the godfather of all text editors.

## Why Git and Vim together?

Git and Vim go together like WPI Freshman and Daka Cookies. They are the two most used tools on my computer besides my bash shell itself. Git and Vim, together with whatever programming language you use, make up your whole development environment. All you need is a terminal to write production grade code--I do it every day.

## What are we going to actually *do* today?

We're going to be writing a small hello world Java program, but we're going to do it in a way that covers a lot of different aspects of Git and Vim. We're going to start by making our git repository, and then write our program in Vim. We're going to go over very specific commands and specific examples of why Git and Vim are so powerful. You may not even compile or run our code--that's not the point.
